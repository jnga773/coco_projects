# Phase Resetting Examples

Here are some example phase resetting examples. 

Here is an outline of the method used to calculated phase resetting curves.

1. Step One: Blah blah blah here's some code
   ```MATLAB
   prob = coco_prob();
   ```

2. Step Two: Blah blah blah
   ```MATLAB
   prob = coco_prob();
   ```
   
3. Step Three: Blah blah blah
   ```MATLAB
   prob = coco_prob();
   ```

4. Step Four: Blah blah blah
   ```MATLAB
   prob = coco_prob();
   ```


## fitz_hugh_nagumo

This is the Fitz-Hugh-Nagumo model. It will calculate some isochrons of the systems

## winfree

This is the Winfree model. It will calculate some phase-resetting curves and phase-transition curves. Basically just recreates Figs. 1 and 2 from "A Continuation Approach to Computing Phase Resetting Curves" by Langfield et al.
